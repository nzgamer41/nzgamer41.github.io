    <p>One last update, thx everyone around ac scene for the support, I've seen your messages everywhere from TP server to places like Project Asakura discord (yeah I've been in there pre much since the project started with an alt, y'all are funny sometimes). Can't guarantee I've fucked off forever but I'm defo taking a break for the immediate future.</p>
    <p>I leave you with one final anecdote re that commit I did with "fuck your mother" in chinese, in Highschool we had a few international students who for some reason got forced to go to a mid tier NZ highschool, and one of the bros was from HKG, and would say that around the boarding houses over the smallest inconvenience. I always thought it was crackup, and he said it was extremely offensive in chinese (there was some other bits but I don't remember how to spell those and would butcher the pronunciation).</p>
